# toodoux, a task manager in CLI / TUI

**toodoux** is a CLI task manager based on several famous softwares (among [Org Mode], [taskwarrior] and [git]).
Even though heavily influenced by Org Mode, it doesn’t plan to implement Org Mode but rather be a
solid and fun task manager to work with. It is made for people who want to to quickly create task
notes, sort them, and add, edit, remove and list what’s around.

See the [initial RFC] for a complete and exhaustive tour of the first, draft version.
